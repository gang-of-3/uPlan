__Problem Statement__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disorganization among students often leads to stress, self-esteem issues, and failing grades.1  Over the past decade, students have increasingly reported feelings of being overwhelmed and depressed.2   Missing assignments due to disorganization can lead to students feeling as though they are spiraling out of control with no chance of catching back up. After missing a few assignments the student may feel that missing one more assignment is not going to make a big difference, so why bother? Each missed assignment leads to a greater feeling of hopelessness and increases the likelihood of the student simply giving up.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic success of a student is the result of a variety of factors, but at the center of academic success is organization.  A student’s ability to remain organized can greatly improve their ability to meet their potential and deliver results.  Despite the necessity of students to remain organized, universities rarely offer cohesive tools to assist in this endeavor. Professors often adopt a variety of different methods for providing information to students, increasing the amount of effort required for a student to keep track of basic information relevant to a course such as upcoming assignments, grades, groups, etc. The disparity between teacher’s methods for distributing assignments makes it easy for students to lose track of important information and fail to reach their full potential.
