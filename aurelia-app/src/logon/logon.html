            The Gang of Three, or Go3, strives to provide digital tools to help students succeed in the modern classroom
            environment. Gang of Three believes that through proper implementation of technology student success can be
            thoroughly supported and assured. Too often technology, which is supposed to assist and simplify
            workstreams, ends up adding complications and obstacles, complicating that which should be simple. We, at
            Gang of Three, believe tools should be easy to use, and help streamline learning, not hinder learning. Above
            all else, Gang of Three seeks to promote learning in an intuitive and stimulating environment, encourage the
            engagement of a student within their academic community, and aid collaboration between peers to promote
            learning in an organic fashion while fostering relationships. Through learning, academic engagement, and
            collaboration, true academic success can be achieved.
