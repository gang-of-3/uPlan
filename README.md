__Problem Assignment__  
The academic success of a student is the result of a variety of factors, but at the center of academic success is organization.  A student’s ability to remain organized can greatly improve their ability to meet their potential and deliver results.  Despite the necessity of students to remain organized, universities rarely offer cohesive tools to assist. Professors often adopt a variety of different methods for providing information to students, increasing the amount of effort required for a student to keep track of basic information relevant to a course such as upcoming assignments, grades, groups, etc. The disparity between teacher’s methods for distributing assignments makes it easy for students to lose track of important information and fail to reach their full potential.
